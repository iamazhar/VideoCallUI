        // Handle main view tap
    }
    
    func didTapEndCall(videoCallController: VideoCallController) {
        // Handle end call
    }
    
    func didTapFloatingCallView(videoCallController: VideoCallController) {
        // Handle floating call view tap
    }
    
    func didTapCameraSwitchButton(videoCallController: VideoCallController) {
        // Handle camera switch
    }
    
    func didTapCameraButton(videoCallController: VideoCallController) {
        // Handle camera button tap
    }
    
    func didTapMicButton(videoCallController: VideoCallController) {
        // Handle mic button tap
    }
}
```
