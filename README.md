Swift 5.1+
UIKit

# Installation

## Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the swift compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding VideoCallUI as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/iamazhar/VideoCallUI.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "1.0.0"))
]
```

# Usage

After installing the library, import it wherever you want to use it:

```swift
import VideoCallUI
```
Add the VideoCallController as a child controller to your target controller.

Implement VideoCallControllerDelegate to handle call events:

```swift
extension YourViewController: VideoCallControllerDelegate {
    func didTapBack(videoCallController: VideoCallController) {
        // Handle back button tap
    }
    
    func didTapMainView(videoCallController: VideoCallController) {
        // Handle main view tap
    }
    
    func didTapEndCall(videoCallController: VideoCallController) {
        // Handle end call
    }
    
    func didTapFloatingCallView(videoCallController: VideoCallController) {
        // Handle floating call view tap
    }
    
    func didTapCameraSwitchButton(videoCallController: VideoCallController) {
        // Handle camera switch
    }
    
    func didTapCameraButton(videoCallController: VideoCallController) {
        // Handle camera button tap
    }
    
    func didTapMicButton(videoCallController: VideoCallController) {
        // Handle mic button tap
    }
}
```
And set the controller's delegate:

```swift
videoCallController.delegate = self
```
